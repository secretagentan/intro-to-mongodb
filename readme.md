## In your squads research these questions

Spend 1 hour researching and answering the following questions.

### What is a database?
```
- A structured set of data held in a computer, 
especially one that is accessible in various ways

- One of the most useful applications of the Web is
its capability to link a website to a database so that
web surfers can search for information

- The Web can serve and collect data

```

### How is accessing data from a database different from accessing data from a plain text file?
```

```

### What does the acronym CRUD stand for? 
```
- "Create, Read, Update, Delete"

```

### In JavaScript what would the CRUD operations on an object or array be?
```

```

### In Databases what is an "atomic transaction"?
```

```

### Why would you use a database for web development?
```

```

### What is NoSQL?
```
- A non-relational and largely distributed database system 
that enables rapid, ad-hoc organization and analysis of
extremly high-volume, disparate data types

- Sometimes referred to as cloud databases, non-relational databases, Big Data databases

- Originally referred to as "non SQL", "non relational", 
"not only SQL"

- Encompasses a wide variety of different database 
technologies that were developed in response to the 
demands presented in building modern applications:
    - Developers working with apps that create massive
    volumes of new, rapidly changing datatypes
    - Now smaller teams work in agile sprints (shorter
    dev cycles)
    - Apps used to be served towards a finite audience - 
    now must be always-on, accessible from different devices,
    and scaled globally
    - Orgs now turning to scale-out architectures using open
    source software, commodity servers and cloud computing
    vs. large monolithic servers and storage infrastructure
- Relational databases were not designed to cope with the 
scale and agility challenges that face modern applications

- NoSQL is a database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data

- NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide superior
performance

- Data model addresses several issues relational model is
not designed to 

- Increasingly used in big data and real-time web apps

- NoSQL Database Types: 
    - Document databases: Pair each key w/ a complex data 
    structure ('document'). Key-value pairs, key-arrays, nested documents
    - Graph stores: Stores information about networks of data (ie. social connections)
    - Key-value stores: Simplest NoSQL databases
    - Wide-column stores: Optimized for queries over large
    datasets, and store columns of data together (instead 
    of rows)

### What is MongoDB?
```

```

### Why do we need MongoDB?
```
- Removes the complex object-relational mapping (ORM) layer
that translates object in code to relational tables 
- Schemaless - easier to work with

```

### What is a schema and does mongoDB have them? Why or why not?
```
- Schema: The organization of data as a blueprint of how the 
database is contructed 
    - A way to logically group objects such as tables, views 
    stored procedures, etc. 
    - "Container of objects" - You can assign a user login 
    permissions to a single schema so that the user can only
    access the objects they are authorized to access 
- MongoDB is schemaless:
    - Data in MongoDB has flexible schema in the same
    collection
    - Do not need to thave the same set of fields or 
    structure
    - Common fields in a collection's documents may hold
    different types of data

```

### What is BSON? How is similar/different from JSON?
```

```

### What is a collection?
```

```

### What is a document?
```
- A document is a complex data structure

```

### What is a Namespace in MongoDB?
```

```

### What is the shell command `mongod` do?
```

```

### What does the shell command `mongo` do?
```

```

### What are the some features of MongoDB?
```

```

### How is data stored?
```

```

### What is a _id field in Mongo?
```
- The primary key for every document 
- Also accessible via "id"

```
